## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with Hooks
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for UI components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Backend
- **Express.js** server
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing
- **CORS** for cross-origin requests

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd coder-hangman-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   
   The `.env` file should already exist with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   
   # MongoDB Connection
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hangman-game
   
   # JWT Secret (change this to a secure random string in production)
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_change_in_production
   
   # Frontend URL (for CORS)
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

   **Important:** Change the `JWT_SECRET` to a secure random string in production!

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Manual Start (Recommended for Development)

1. **Start MongoDB:**
   - If using local MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB service is running
   - If using MongoDB Atlas: Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` with your connection string

2. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

3. **In a new terminal, start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 2: Development with Auto-reload

If you want auto-reload for the server during development, install nodemon globally:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
npm run dev:server
```

## Usage

1. **Visit the application** at `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Sign up for a new account** or login if you already have one

3. **Select game options:**
   - Programming Language (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, React)
   - Topic (Functions, Arrays, Classes, etc.)
   - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

4. **Play the game:**
   - Guess letters to complete the missing word in the code snippet
   - You have 6 wrong guesses before the game ends
   - Win points for successful completions

5. **Track your progress:**
   - View your profile for detailed statistics
   - Check the leaderboard to see top players
   - Review your game history

## Game Rules

- Each correct guess reveals matching letters in the word
- Wrong guesses add parts to the hangman drawing
- Win by guessing the complete word before 6 wrong guesses
- Scoring: 10 points per successful game, 0 points for losses
- Scores are only saved for authenticated users

## Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run server` - Start Express server
- `npm run dev:server` - Start server with auto-reload
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Quick Start Guide

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run server` in one terminal
4. Run `npm run dev` in another terminal
5. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
6. Create an account and start playing!

## Security Notes

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Set secure JWT secret (min 32 characters)
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
